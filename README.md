# college-schedule

This training project has evolved from a UML plan to a Spring-only application, and eventually to a Spring Boot app.

If run as intended, it will prompt for a username and a password. The default administrator username/passowrd pair is admin@mail.com and admin; the default normal user credentials are user@mail.com and user.

The application allows to store records for students, groups, professors, courses and lessons in a relational database. It can be used as a basis for a college training schedule web application.

This is one of my training projects.
